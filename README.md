## Proposal
It  goes  without  saying  that  traditional  text-based memorizing   technique   is   not   effective.   The   problem   behind memorizing  words  is  that  memorized  words  are  often  stored in  the  short-term  memory  of  our  brain,  not  in  the  long-term memory  section.  In  practice,  combining  learning  activity  with a  forgetting  curve  has  been  proved  to  substantially  improve  the effectiveness  of  studying.  In  this  paper,  we  make  the  first  study to  enhance  human  memorization  via  the  forgetting  curve  using the  NUGU  AI  speaker.  The  user  goes  through  two  stages,  which are  the  learning  and  test  stage.  In  the  learning  stage,  the  user repetitively  learns  the  vocabulary  of  choice  and  the  NUGU  AIspeaker  helps  this  process  by  reading  the  word.

## Related software and research
### Memo  Review
- Feature: Helps the user to memorize vocabularies with various learning methods such as "listen-and-write" and "word  card". It also shows vocabularies on human forgetting curb.
- Difference: This application  does  not  support  the test  stage  like  Brain-Engraver.  We  compute  the "likely-to-be-forgotten-words"   based   on   test   results  with  the  human  forgetting  curve  algorithm.
- Review:  There  are  only  six  reviews,  and  most  of them  said  it  is  a  waste  of  money  because  of  its slow  loading.

### Memorize.ai:  Learn  Lazily
- Feature:  It  uses  artificial  intelligence (they  do  not give  specific  detail  about  what  algorithm  or  what technique  they  used  for  this  application).  It  supports  a  feature  called  "Spaced  Repetition".  This application  supports  LaTeX,  and  code  editors.
- Difference:  It  is  not  specified  in  memorizing  vocabularies  like  our  Brain-Engraver.
- Review:  5  out  of  6  reviews  said  it  was  good,  but  1 of  the  review  claimed  that  it  crashes  consistently.

### Research   Paper: A   Memorizing   Model   of   Effective English  Study  by  Kyung  Lan  Kim
- It  goes  on  to  detail  about  the  fact  that  memorizing  a  vocabulary  based  on  Ebbinghaus  human forgetting  curve  theory  is  better  than  just  hard-memorizing  the  words.
- Difference:  The  paper  only  describes  the  effectiveness  of  memorization  based  on  the  human forgetting curve. It does not provide any software-related  method.
